# Manual ClassLabeling Environment

This project uses the Google Maps API and USDA National Farmers Market Directory API to create a mashup where visitors can search for Farmers Markets in the US by entering a zip code, then Farmers Markets near that zip code will be shown on the map. You can click on a marker or an item in the result list to view more info about the market such as address, schedule, and products.
